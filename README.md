# CMakeModules
A collection of CMakeModules for libraries we use or support, as well as many different functions.  Need to reliably locate a library with CMake, or get a function to make a part of code more efficient?  This is the repository for you.

## Updates
As libraries get updated, our modules are subject to change at any given time.  Please be advised that mismatching versions between the library and CMake module may cause unexpected issues!

## Found a problem?
Please report it via GitHub's issue tracker.  Make sure you:

- Updated the library
- Updated the CMake module
- Given as much detail as you can

We appreciate your work to solve an issue!  Feel free to send a pull request to be reviewed.  Please make sure you:

- Have thoroughly tested it
- Follow our own code style (mainly indentation via tabs)
- Mention the issue the PR is solving if applicable
